        paragraph : ellesse founder Leonardo Servadio started out as a tailor in his hometown Perugia, 
                    Italy. Like many great ideas, ellesse — which gets its name from Servadio’s initials L.S. —  
                    was a way for its founder to scratch his own itch. Born into a family of textile merchants, 
                    Servadio dreamt of fashion-forward sportswear that suited his stylish, tailored aesthetic. 
                    With nothing satisfying available, Servadio decided to apply his knowledge to redefining 
                    sportswear and, with that, ellesse was born.
