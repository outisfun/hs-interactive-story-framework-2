          highlight:  "Call it a comeback if you will, but DC’s popularity in recent years — due in large part to a refocused strategy and a spate of high-profile 
                      collaborations — has prompted the California skate brand to revamp its range of heritage sneakers and create a new forum for expression 
                      through its exclusive DC Reserve program."
          paragraph:  "Launched just over a year ago, DC Reserve celebrates and expands upon some of DC’s most iconic 
                      styles by offering limited-edition OG reissues, collabs with some of the most sought after designers and brands, and exclusive new colorways 
                      — all in a bid to merge its rich history with a refined vision for the future of skateboarding. 
                      <br><br>
                      In the early ‘90s, DC pioneered a unique vision of blending skate with fringe cultures that were just coming up, namely graffiti and streetwear, 
                      and took them mainstream. Now, as DC plans to expand and grow the program with a slate of new releases for 2019 and beyond, we spoke with some 
                      of the people and brands behind the scenes who were pivotal to DC’s growth to see what they’ve been cooking up.<br><br>"
