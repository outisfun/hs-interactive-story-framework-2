          highlight:  "Call it a comeback if you will, but DC’s popularity in recent years — due in large part to a refocused strategy and a spate of high-profile 
                      collaborations — has prompted the California skate brand to revamp its range of heritage sneakers and create a new forum for expression 
                      through its exclusive DC Reserve program."
          paragraph:  "Launched just over a year ago, DC Reserve celebrates and expands upon some of DC’s most iconic 
                      styles by offering limited-edition OG reissues, collabs with some of the most sought after designers and brands, and exclusive new colorways 
                      — all in a bid to merge its rich history with a refined vision for the future of skateboarding. 
                      <br><br>
                      In the early ‘90s, DC pioneered a unique vision of blending skate with fringe cultures that were just coming up, namely graffiti and streetwear, 
                      and took them mainstream. Now, as DC plans to expand and grow the program with a slate of new releases for 2019 and beyond, we spoke with some 
                      of the people and brands behind the scenes who were pivotal to DC’s growth to see what they’ve been cooking up.<br><br>"

          paragraph:  "DC cares deeply about self-expression and paved the way for collaboration culture in sneakers during the early aughts with a first-of-its-kind 
                      artist series program, and DC Reserve, in a way, is the culmination and progression of that work. “[DC] Reserve is a space for them to experiment, 
                      kind of go outside of a comfort zone,” explained 
                      former DC footwear designer Sung Choi, who designed the Lynx — arguably DC’s most iconic sneaker. 
                      “These projects are the culmination of two different energies: DC and the partnership.” 
                      By partnering with local brands and designers intimately tied to the skate community, like Los Angeles-based FTP and Australian label Sports 
                      Class, DC continues to spur dialogue and create conversations around modern skate culture in ways that are authentic to both themselves 
                      and the sport.<br><br>
                      DC recently brought Choi back on board to lead the DC Reserve program and remarks on some of his favorite upcoming projects to date, 
                      including a super luxe version of the Lynx that designer Jon Buscemi has reworked. Watch the video above to see what else is in 
                      store for the DC Reserve program in 2019 and the year to come, and stay tuned for the next exclusive drop."
