          highlight:  Swatch and BAPE are both masters of collaboration. First collaborating with artist Kiki Picasso in 1985, 
                      Swatch has worked over the years with legends such as Keith Haring, Vivienne Westwood, Damien Hirst, and Jeremy Scott. 
                      BAPE, it goes without saying, has been even more prolific, touching almost every aspect of modern culture and 
                      collaborating with everyone from Marvel to Google since the mid-‘90s.
          paragraph:  Unsurprisingly then we were pleased to learn earlier this month that Swatch and BAPE are at last coming 
                      together for a marriage of two OG collaborators and undeniably iconic brands. While today’s “collabs” are often 
                      just another part of the news cycle — hyped today and gone tomorrow — Swatch x BAPE has been somewhat of a long 
                      time coming and a collaboration we always hoped we’d see from two names with a history of killer partnerships.<br><br>
                      To make the news more exciting, it’ll be Swatch’s all-new BIG BOLD model that gets the BAPE treatment as the pair 
                      have come together to reimagine BIG BOLD in five city-inspired colorways and one global colorway.<br><br>
                      To prepare for today’s global drop, keep reading to find out why this collaboration is noteworthy and check out 
                      all six colorways.
