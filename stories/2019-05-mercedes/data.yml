          highlight: Among humanities greatest achievements, our shift from horse-drawn
            carriages to engine-driven vehicles is one that has revolutionized the
            way we live.
          paragraph: 'It’s been over one hundred thirty-three years since Carl Benz
            patented the first automobile in Berlin, Germany in 1886, and we’re still
            feeling its effects. It struck the world like a lightning bolt, reimagining
            how we travel and connect, and put what would become the Mercedes-Benz
            company on the map.<br><br>There aren’t many ways to outflex the invention
            of the automobile. Yet, somehow, Mercedes-Benz has made lightning strike
            twice — this time almost literally. After a century of paving the way
            with automobiles renowned for their quality and comfort, they’ve raced
            into a new dawn in the driver’s seat of the fully electric Mercedes-Benz
            EQC Edition 1886. Packing 133 years of history into the seamless, LED-outfitted
            chassis, the limited edition model of the new Mercedes-Benz EQC 400 4MATIC
            line is a window into the past and future of cars. It’s at once both a
            time capsule to the birth of the automobile and a gleaming look at a future
            driven by Mercedes-Benz’ new electric mobility brand, Electric Intelligence
            (EQ).<br><br>The EQC line is designed to make us enjoy again and find
            our passion — whether it be birdwatching, beach-bumming, or something
            else entirely. With tech-packed interiors and engines as quiet as a monk’s
            chambers, it certainly makes the case for being an antidote to the loud
            shout of the modern world. But, before we can look to the future of driving,
            it’s essential we go back to the beginning and tell the story of how Carl
            Benz changed the world forever.'

          highlight: Behind every great origin story is a dream and a path paved with
            small achievements. For Carl Benz, that dream came to him in 1877 in the
            form of a “vehicle without horses.”
          paragraph: Sparked by the thought, he toiled away for a year on a gas-driven,
            two-stroke engine capable of revolutionizing transportation. It would
            take months of failure and tinkering but, on New Year’s Eve in 1878, he
            got his engine running for the first time — providing the fuel needed
            to keep fighting for his vision.<br><br>Five years after that fateful
            day, Benz launched a two-stroke “System Benz” engine fit for the market
            but too big and heavy to be installed into any vehicle at the time. In
            a move born out of necessity, he built an entirely new automobile fit
            with a four-stroke engine. With his dream turned into a reality at last,
            he braved the cold winter air and left Berlin’s German Imperial Patent
            Office on 29 January 1886 with the birth certificate for a “gas-powered
            vehicle” that changed the world forever.

            individual mobility to the auto industry, the ethos of the OG Motorwagen
            has been stitched into the spirit (and seats) of the Mercedes-Benz EQC
            Edition 1886. It’s a new dawn for the company and the concept of electric
            mobility and, this time, we’re along for the ride.

            darkest just before the Day dawneth.” Now, finally, the new day for electric
            has dawned with a little help from the legendary German automaker.'
          paragraph: 'It’s fitting that Mercedes-Benz’s pioneering spirit would eventually
            turn to electric cars. Like the horse-drawn carriages of generations past,
            the electric car could use some pioneering spirit and a few fuel cells
            worth of fun. Make Electric Enjoyable Again, if you will. As much as we’d
            like to say the experience of driving electric has been as exciting as
            it looked in science fiction films, the reality has been more “stranded
            on the Autobahn with no charge.” Not exactly a cute vibe for automobiles
            that should be the future of driving. '

          paragraph: "The problem isn’t that electric is a snooze.  Great strides
            have been made to put these cars on the cutting edge of technology as
            charging stations multiply like rabbits around the world. But, somewhere
            along the way, they’ve lost an essential ingredient: joy. It’s a problem
            that’s been at the forefront of Mercedes-Benz’s foray into electric and
            now, two words are helping bring joy back to the art of the joyride in
            their fully electric fleet: Electric Intelligence.<br><br>No, not intelligence
            in the sentient “talking cars in a sleepy town off Route 66” kind of way.
            With the launch of the EQC as Mercedes-Benz’s first model under the EQ
            brand, the automaker is ushering in a new era.<br><br>EQ is an ecosystem
            of services designed to bring intelligence to electromobility that goes
            far beyond driving. We live in a weird, wild world these days and if we’ve
            learned anything, it's that technology should be as easy, quick, and
            convenient as possible."

            navigation systems, the standout feature is one tailor-made for our weary
            souls: silence.<br><br>It’s a sensation that has become a precious commodity
            in a world that gets noisier by the day and within the EQC’s spacious
            cabin, there’s enough of it to fill a monastery. Like every inch of the
            car, the meditative calm is carefully constructed. Insulation meant to
            keep out diesel engine noise and foam layered into the tires fights back
            against the sort of road noise that studies have shown overwhelmingly
            contributes to fatigue. All that’s left is the sound of silence and the
            open road.'

          paragraph: Of course, the goal of the EQC line wasn’t just to master the
            art of silence; though it does certainly help with carve out time for
            morning meditation on the commute. Mercedes-Benz’s vision of a new dawn
            for driving isn’t just about creating a monk-like cabin and an ecosystem
            of smart technology. It’s about turning the EQC into a vessel for finding
            your passion — whether it be a walk in the woods or, perhaps, a winding
            drive along the cliffs to go birdwatching.
