                      An artist famous on the ‘gram for painting boys’ nails and a Black, queer transgender spoken word poet walk

          paragraph:  Underneath all of the headline-making 
                      drama about Brexit, a new creative renaissance has gripped Britain’s capital city; one that brings together 
                      Jess Young, a painter dealing in tiny brushstrokes applied to our built-up keratin, and Kai-Isaiah Jamal, 
                      an artist weaving words into emotional exposés of identity. As different as they may seem on the surface, 
                      both artists have come of age in an era where creative communities 
                      of color and artist collectives have risen up to make major waves in art scenes long dominated by white, cisgender man. 
                      Whether that collective is the feminist nail art girls at cult salon WAH Nails that watched Jess grow for the last 
                      five years or the Bold Brazen Zamis (BBZ) Collective of queer womxn, trans folk and non-binary people of colour 
                      that Kai has come to embrace as family.
