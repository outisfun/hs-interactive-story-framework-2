          highlight:  Over the last few months, we’ve taken a close look at ellesse’s sportswear and tailoring history, including its origins and its 
                      reemerging relevance within today’s style zeitgeist. In a three-part series, we’ve also challenged fashion students in New York, 
                      London, and now Berlin to customize and style ellesse’s SS19 collection — reimagining it through the lens of tomorrow’s top 
                      fashion talent.
          paragraph:  The latest lookbook is perhaps the most fitting homage to ellesse’s founder Leonardo Servadio. When Servadio launched ellesse 
                      in 1959, the small-town tailor decided to break the style and sportswear rules of the time by introducing his tailoring expertise 
                      to sportswear design. The result was sports clothing that was as wearable on the track and field as it was for day-to-day living — 
                      in a sense, giving birth to comfortable lifestyle-wear or what we might now call athleisure.<br><br>
                      Like Servadio, Berlin-based fashion student Kasia Kucharska brings a unique background to her field. Kucharska studied interior 
                      architecture in Stuttgart and Japan prior to embarking on a fashion design masters program at Berlin’s Universität der Künste. 
                      As a result, she enjoys experimenting with manufacturing techniques such as gluing, laser cutting, welding, deep drawing, and plugging.
                      <br><br>
                      Kucharska employs these techniques and more in her lookbook heavily inspired by ellesse’s tailoring-meets-sportswear heritage. 
                      Check out the outcome below and keep reading for insight into how it came together including an interview with Kucharska herself.

          paragraph:  “The future is now” — this is Kasia Kucharska’s motto and something she applies to all of her work. 
                      It’s a forward-thinking philosophy that in many ways also inspired the founding of ellesse.<br><br>
                      For Kucharska, it’s meant not just working with innovative new methods but striving to discover and 
                      develop manufacturing technologies and techniques that allow her to push the boundaries of design and 
                      manifest the future as she imagines it.<br><br>
                      We spoke to Kucharska to find out more about all of this and her work on the ellesse project. 
                      Read on below.

                      For this project, you were inspired by ellesse’s rich tailoring and sportswear history. 
                      What attracted you to this history and why is it something you wanted to focus on?
                      </strong>
                      <br><br>
                      The history of tailored clothing has been intense with me now for many months as it’s been a 
                      prominent topic for my master's collection. History is a trustful and reliable source of inspiration, 
                      that's what I like about it most. I find inspiration in old manufacturing techniques or in 
                      evolutionary processes of clothing and I like to recall and rethink these techniques and processes 
                      and apply them in a relevant way to today's wardrobe."

                      Personally, I am a very convenient person. I like products and garments that are multifunctional. 
                      I wanted to create pieces that are convertible and multipurpose and which you can wear in different 
                      ways by simply adding them to your existing wardrobe — like functional accessories or tools."

                      your needs and not the other way around."

                      Describe for us why you picked each of the pieces you used from ellesse.
                      </strong>
                      <br><br>
                      I wanted to work with male garments and adjust them to the female body. It is sort of something 
                      that also happened throughout history with tailored clothing. The suit was initially made for men 
                      and later adjusted to the female body. I like to take that as a starting point for my own projects 
                      too. For example, I took the tracksuit apart and constructed a garment which can be worn as a 
                      dress or a skirt, both in different ways. You can adjust it in length and size. Its basically 
                      one size fits all but you can still customize it according to your needs.<br><br>
                      I liked the loose fit, colors, and technical fabrics of the <a href = '#' target = '_blank'>
                      Fighter Jacket</a> and <a href = '#' target = '_blank'>Typhoon Trousers</a> — 
                      they were perfect for translating my idea of garment adaptation."

                      What routines, habits, or practices do you have that keep you focused and boost your creativity?
                      </strong>
                      <br><br>
                      As I grow older, I really believe it’s the breaks and recreation you allow yourself that 
                      keep you focused. In your head, the creative process never stops; you continuously develop 
                      ideas and it’s hard to escape that process. The breaks where you’re actually not in the 
                      studio surrounded by all the work make you rethink and evaluate your ideas. I really 
                      like to take my time with that in order to create something that makes sense.

                      </strong>
                      I would love to continue my own practice, my laboratory in fashion, as I did in university. 
                      I am very much into new technologies and love to explore manufacturing techniques which are 
                      not fashion related in order to create garments. There is so much potential for innovation.
