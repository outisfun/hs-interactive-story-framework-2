                      Like many great ideas, ellesse — which gets its name from Servadio’s initials L.S. — 
                      was a way for its founder to scratch his own itch. Born into a family of textile merchants, 
                      Servadio dreamt of fasdasddafadsdfdsdfsshion-forward sportswear that suited his stylish, tailored aesthetic. 
                      With nothing satisfying available, Servadio decided to apply his knowledge to redefining 
                      sportswear and, with that, ellesse was born in 1959.
