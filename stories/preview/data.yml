          highlight: On July 3 1973, David Bowie announced the retirement of his alter
            ego, Ziggy Stardust, on stage at London’s Hammersmith Odeon Theatre. “Not
            only is this the last show of the tour, but it’s the last show that we’ll

          paragraph: Sir Bowie? He turned down the offer of knighthood from the Queen
            in 2003. “I would never have any intention of accepting anything like
            that,” he said. “I seriously don’t know what it’s for. It’s not what I
            spent my life working for.
