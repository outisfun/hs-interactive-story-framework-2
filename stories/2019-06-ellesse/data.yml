          paragraph:  ellesse founder Leonardo Servadio started out as a tailor in his hometown Perugia, Italy. 
                      Like many great ideas, ellesse — which gets its name from Servadio’s initials L.S. — 
                      was a way for its founder to scratch his own itch. Born into a family of textile merchants, 
                      Servadio dreamt of fasdasddafadsdfdsdfsshion-forward sportswear that suited his stylish, tailored aesthetic. 
                      With nothing satisfying available, Servadio decided to apply his knowledge to redefining 
                      sportswear and, with that, ellesse was born in 1959.

          highlight:  'In the beginning, ellesse made apparel for two quintessentially Italian sports: 
                      skiing and tennis. Servadio’s tailored approach led to iconic designs like the Jet Pant 
                      which was included at a celebration of Italian design at the Pompidou Centre in 1979.'
          paragraph:  Fast forward 60 years, however, and while tennis and ski live on in ellesse’s designs 
                      and logo, the label is as much a fashion brand as it is a sporting one. Here’s a look 
                      back at some of ellesse’s most memorable designs and how they continue to influence 
                      today’s collections.<br><br>

          paragraph:  Today, ellesse is known for being a fashion brand as much as it is for being a sports brand. 
                      In recent collections, its tailoring and sportswear heritage seamlessly converge with contemporary fashion trends and ellesse’s 
                      recognizable color palette and semi-palla logo are ever-present symbols of the brand’s identity and history.
                      <br><br>
                      Yet, now, sportswear is having a similar impact on tailoring as tailoring had on sportswear under ellesse and Servadio’s influence. 
                      Today’s tailored garments take as much from streetwear and sportswear as they do Italian traditions and people are subverting the 
                      association of suiting with drudgery.
                      <br><br>
                      Honoring ellesse’s past, here’s how we shot and styled ellesse’s current offering.

                    We’ve just been dicking around today really.” After spending the previous evening in a London pub — a somewhat second 
                    home for Hodges having worked in one up until just a couple of years ago — it had been a somewhat slow start to the day. 
                    Now the afternoon, we were meeting to discuss his new collaboration with ellesse that was first teased back in January 
                    during his London Fashion Week Men’s Fall/Winter 2019 show."

          paragraph: "Hodges and his team work from a studio space in Newham, East London, and despite a penchant for mischief and play, 
                      together they’ve helped grow the Liam Hodges brand exponentially over the last five years. Still in its youth, 
                      the brand evolves each season, but every collection aims to redefine the meaning of aspirational with positive, 
                      forward-looking statements inspired by Hodges’ ceaseless curiosity towards music, film, and books. “There’s this 
                      old, archaic version of aspirational, the early 2000s version of cars and money and stuff like that,” he explains. 
                      “And I think, nowadays, there’s much more value in relevance and knowledge.” The Liam Hodges mission statement has 
                      led its namesake designer to turn some aspects of running a fashion business on their head. In the past, Hodges 
                      has created zines rather than putting out traditional advertising and partnered with avante-garde music artists 
                      such as GAIKA to soundtrack his shows. In doing so, he’s attracted the attention of Drake and Stormzy, amongst 
                      others, but in truth, Hodges admits to just designing clothes that his mates would wear."

          paragraph: "Hodges’ mental library touches upon everything from popular culture to more esoteric topics. It is, in part, the 
                      reason his work is so diverse and his appeal so cross-cultural. In 2016 he described an obsession with Adam Curtis’ 
                      yperNormalisation; his SS19 collection was directly influenced by his reading of Donna Tartt’s 2013 novel <i>The Goldfinch</i>; 
                      oday, on his desk, I spot a copy of Yuval Noah Harari’s <i>21 Lessons for the 21st Century</i>. Case in point: Hodges is a 
                      sponge for knowledge. <br><br> “That’s kind of where inspiration comes from, isn’t it, it’s from books and museums and stuff. 
                      It’s not like I just go ‘ding’, and have it all right there. When I was doing the last collection I got really into a book 
                      called <i>Alone Together</i> which is a study of how technology has changed people, changed how we communicate, and what we think 
                      we are. Then there’s <i>The Shallows</i> which looks at how technology has changed the way our brains work, not needing to remember 
                      things in the same way anymore, for example. But I guess that’s just what excites me, books, and comics books. And music. 
                      I’m going to see Tommy Cash on Friday and I’ve been listening to Ho99o9 a lot recently when cycling to work, it helps me 
                      get there faster.”"

          paragraph:  Hodges keeps his finger on the pulse of culture and one eye locked curiously on the future, but for his new project 
                      with ellesse he also had a direct link to the past, accessing and looking for inspiration in the brand’s archive in North 
                      London. Hodges has mentioned in the past that he’d been keen to work with an iconic label’s archive and this was one factor 
                      that drew him to the project. “I’d never seen a brand’s archive before, the way the clothes were designed, drawn, presented, 
                      and even sold was very interesting,” he explains. The archive was stocked floor to ceiling with all manner of apparel spanning 
                      ecades, each a chapter in ellesse’s history book. But, surprisingly (or not considering his typically unconventional approach), 
                      Hodges was most attracted to old sales books and technical drawings that spoke, in particular, to ellesse’s history of bringing 
                      together sportswear with traditional elements of tailoring.<br><br>One classic campaign that caught Hodges’ attention was for a ski 
                      collection — the sport that ellesse was built on. Hodges knew ellesse’s ski campaigns well, explaining that fashion students 
                      bring them up every time he teaches a sportswear course at the University of Westminster (his old stomping ground), but 
                      discovering and tracing their origins shone a new light on everything he’d seen before.

      ellesse__liamhodges__ellesse:
        elementType: text
        elementData: 
          paragraph:  ellesse was born in 1959 when founder Leonardo Servadio decided to bring his tailoring background to sportswear, 
                      changing the category forever into one that could be fashionable as well as highly functional. For some years, ellesse 
                      focused predominantly on ski gear and Servadio’s understanding of tailoring informed iconic designs like the Jet Pant — 
                      a ski pant with padded knees and a wide lower leg that fit over a ski boot — and quilted jackets. Not long after and 
                      building on the success of its ski apparel, ellesse began making clothing for tennis and with this, the brand’s two 
                      ounding pillars were put firmly in place. Servadio proved that tailoring techniques could be of benefit to a performance 
                      piece’s purpose but in improving the overall design aesthetic, also discovered that sportswear could have fashion appeal. 
                      The Jet Pant was such a breakthrough that in 1979 it featured at an event at the Pompidou Centre in Paris celebrating 
                      Italian design. Given its history and the rising popularity of modern interpretations of tailoring today, it’s no wonder 
                      that Hodges wanted ellesse’s old ski gear to form the framework of their collaboration.<br><br>“We didn’t want to do a heritage 
                      collaboration. Because that’s crap, we’ve seen that a million times” Hodges explains. “For this one, it felt more about 
                      it being of the moment. Something that felt relevant to them and to us, representative of both brands, rather than too 
                      much one way or the other.” In his eyes, there’s no point in working with another label just to make the same clothes 
                      that he puts on the catwalk but, equally, he saw it as his responsibility to persuade ellesse to travel in directions 
                      they might usually avoid. Hodges got permission to play with their logo and branding, for example; he was adamant on 
                      using certain materials and fabrics that he knew would elevate the collection, like rubber on the sneakers. “Chopping 
                      a brand’s logo up is something that brands normally wouldn’t let you do. They really supported me and my ideas, and they 
                      let me get on with it,” he says."

        elementData: 
          paragraph: Something Hodges knew ellesse would support based on their history with tailoring was the introduction of new fits and cuts. 
                      It was ellesse after all that first introduced many of the design innovations to sportswear during the ‘60s and ‘70s 
                      that we’re familiar with today. Hodges reiterates that this was never going to be a heritage collection and he wasn’t 
                      going to pull and copy stuff directly, but simply playing with fits and cuts in his own way is a subtle nod to the archive 
                      considering what we know about ellesse’s past. He examined old samples and pictures thoroughly but he put the physical 
                      references aside when he started drawing, “it’s always a new thing then, right? Because it’s my memory of it rather than 
                      this carbon copy.”

        elementType: text
        elementData: 
          paragraph: Hodges’ approach was to spin his favorite elements from the ellesse archive and leave his aesthetic or conceptual mark on 
                      them. “The ski pants and the ski jacket were really important for us because that's where ellesse’s heritage lies. For us 
                      to update them in our way, mixing the fabrics and adding the print that goes across most of the collection, was really fun,” 
                      e explains. “We really went into the details, so on the tracksuits, we’ve got special zip pulls and stuff, then we’ve added 
                      these wavy lines and played with the colors. Another thing I loved from the ellesse archive was there use of double branding, 
                      so on some pieces, we’ve got the ellesse name on one side and the ‘semi palla’ logo on the other.” The print Hodges mentions 
                      is the ice and salt crystal graphic that’s another abstract reference to ellesse’s ski heritage.

        elementType: text
        elementData: 
          paragraph: Considering Hodges’ reading list and his brand's forward-thinking philosophy, it’s unsurprising that he wanted to incorporate 
                      visions of the future into the collaboration. Besides, ellesse themselves have brought a progressive approach to design since 
                      Servadio founded the label in the ‘50s. In order to incorporate both a vision of the future and the ellesse archive though, 
                      Hodges approached the collection with a retrofuturist mindset. “It’s a view of the future from the nineties!” he explained. 
                      “I’ve got this picture of my dad from when I was super young and he’s got these silver running shorts on, so we were adamant 
                      that there had to be silver, there was something about silver sportswear that just felt like the future back then.”

        elementData: 
          paragraph: "In the end, Hodges describes the collection in simple terms, “It feels very ellesse but it’s definitely got our handwriting 
                      all over it.” In part, it’s this nonchalance and refusal to complicate things that make him and his team such a formidable 
                      force. It’s also why the ellesse collaboration works so well — both brands give one another the space and respect they 
                      deserve. Liam Hodges is a brand with clear intent: it’s aspirational, forward-looking, and positive. Likewise, ellesse has 
                      never veered too far from its founder’s original mission to create stylish sportswear with the help of specialist tailoring 
                      techniques. These are the type of credible values that people crave from brands today and unsurprisingly the collection has 
                      been met with praise. As a result, the pair are already working on a Spring/Summer 2020 collection — Hodges wouldn’t show or 
                      ell me anything about it other than that it’s informed by the other half of ellesse’s bedrock: tennis.<br><br>Until then though, if 
                      there’s one important lesson we can all learn from Liam Hodges and his team it’s that you can run a successful luxury fashion 
                      label and still piss off to the pub in the middle of the day with your mates.<br><br>"
